# packet_manipulation
An all-in-one penetration testing tool written in Python3 using the Scapy library for packet manipulation

This script includes functions for scanning the local network for active hosts, performing port scans on a specified host, ARP spoofing to redirect traffic, and DNS spoofing to redirect traffic to a specified IP. Note that this is just a simple example and not a fully-featured penetration testing tool.
